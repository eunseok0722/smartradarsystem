                                Radar sensors are already used extensively in the field of automotive safety, such as collision avoidance and blind
                                spot detection.It is also expected to be used actively in the 360-degree surround scanning of autonomous driving.
                                In recent years, due to the emergence of CMOS-based one-chip radar chipsets, which integrate radar RF modules
                                and signal processing modules, implementing low cost small radar modules are possible.One-chip radar chipsets
                                are expected to be adopted in the industrial and consumer markets as well.
                                Applications include surveillance, people counting, gesture recognition, and material classification.
